		<h1>NWIS Site Types</h1>

		<p>
		There are 56 possible site types used in the NWIS data base, including 14 primary types and 42 secondary types. To simplify mapping of the site locations for most practical applications, the site types are displayed in 5 groups that include the following primary and secondary types. The full list of site types can be found <a href="help/sitetype.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

		<p>
		The groundwater group includes 2 primary and 10 secondary site types.</p>

		<p>
		Each site type is identified by a 2 to 7 character code. The first 2 characters identify the primary site type, and the remaining characters identify the secondary type. Most sites are one of the principal site types.<p>

		<tr align="left">
		<td>GW<BR></td>
		<td>Well<BR></td>
		<td>A hole or shaft constructed in the earth intended to be used to locate, sample, or develop groundwater, oil, gas, or some other subsurface material. The diameter of a well is typically much smaller than the depth. Wells are also used to artificially recharge groundwater or to pressurize oil and gas production zones.  Additional information about specific kinds of wells should be recorded under the secondary site types or the Use of Site field. Underground waste-disposal wells should be classified as waste-injection wells.<BR></td></tr>

		<tr align="left">
		<td>GW-CR<BR></td>
		<td>Collector or Ranney type well<BR></td>
		<td>An infiltration gallery consisting of one or more underground laterals through which groundwater is collected and a vertical caisson from which groundwater is removed.  Also known as a "horizontal well". These wells produce large yield with small drawdown.<BR></td></tr>

		<tr align="left">
		<td>GW-EX<BR></td>
		<td>Extensometer well<BR></td>
		<td>A well equipped to measure small changes in the thickness of the penetrated sediments, such as those caused by groundwater withdrawal or recharge.<BR></td></tr><tr align="left"><td>GW-HZ<BR></td><td>Hyporheic-zone well<BR></td><td>A permanent well, drive point, or other device intended to sample a saturated zone in close proximity to a stream.<BR></td></tr>

		<tr align="left">
		<td>GW-IW<BR></td>
		<td>Interconnected wells<BR></td>
		<td>Collector or drainage wells connected by an underground lateral.<BR></td></tr><tr align="left"><td>GW-MW<BR></td><td>Multiple wells<BR></td><td>A group of wells that are pumped through a single header and for which little or no data about the individual wells are available.<BR></td></tr>

		<tr align="left">
		<td>GW-TH<BR></td>
		<td>Test hole not completed as a well<BR></td>
		<td>An uncased hole (or one cased only temporarily) that was drilled for water, or for geologic or hydrogeologic testing. It may be equipped temporarily with a pump in order to make a pumping test, but if the hole is destroyed after testing is completed, it is still a test hole. A core hole drilled as a part of mining or quarrying exploration work should be in this class.<BR></td></tr>

		<tr align="left">
		<td>SB<BR></td>
		<td>Subsurface<BR></td>
		<td>A location below the land surface, but not a well, soil hole, or excavation.<BR></td></tr>

		<tr align="left">
		<td>SB-CV<BR></td>
		<td>Cave<BR></td>
		<td>A natural open space within a rock formation large enough to accommodate a human. A cave may have an opening to the outside, is always underground, and sometimes submerged. Caves commonly occur by the dissolution of soluble rocks, generally limestone, but may also be created within the voids of large-rock aggregations, in openings along seismic faults, and in lava formations.<BR></td></tr>

		<tr align="left">
		<td>SB-GWD<BR></td>
		<td>Groundwater drain<BR></td>
		<td>An underground pipe or tunnel through which groundwater is artificially diverted to surface water for the purpose of reducing erosion or lowering the water table.  A drain is typically open to the atmosphere at the lowest elevation, in contrast to a well which is open at the highest point.<BR></td></tr>

		<tr align="left">
		<td>SB-TSM<BR></td>
		<td>Tunnel, shaft, or mine<BR></td>
		<td>A constructed subsurface open space large enough to accommodate a human that is not substantially open to the atmosphere and is not a well. The excavation may have been for minerals, transportation, or other purposes. See also: Excavation.<BR></td></tr>

		<tr align="left">
		<td>SB-UZ<BR></td>
		<td>Unsaturated zone<BR></td>
		<td>A site equipped to measure conditions in the subsurface deeper than a soil hole, but above the water table or other zone of saturation.<BR></td></tr>
