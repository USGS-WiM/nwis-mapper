        <h2>Current Conditions</h2>
		<p>
	By default, current conditions are defined as data received within the previous 7 days. The number of days used to define current conditions can be set by the user. Enter a number in the box and then click on the right arrow to activate the new setting. Any number of days between 1 and 183 (6 months) can be entered. If a site has not had data transmitted and received within the set number of days, it will not appear on the map. For example, if you only want to show sites that have up-to-date data, a value of 1 day would not include sites that are not sending new data due to a malfunction or other interruption.</p>
