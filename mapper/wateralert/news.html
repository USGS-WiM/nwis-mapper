            <h1>WaterAlert News</h1>
           
            <h2>September 30, 2013: New features available in map interface.</h2>
            <ul>
            	<li>Opening map is centered and zoomed on the city closest to your internet address. In most cases this will get you close to data sites of most interest.</li>
            	<li>Select Location has been moved to the top of control options. This is the control most used.</li>
            	<li>News is available in each control option. Keeps you up to date with new features and service announcements.</li>
            	<li>Clicking on a site will show most recent data values.</li>
                <li>Subscription can be created directly from site information pop-up.</li>
            	<li>Minimum zoom level for clickable sites has been changed from 8 to 9 to improve performance.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>September 18, 2013: WaterAlert search and help moved to new web pages.</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Due to expiration of our web mapping license from Google, we have redesigned the map interface to use ESRI web mapping. This provides several advantages over our old interface:
              <ul>
                <li>Layout and functionality are similar to the National Water Information System Mapper, which is a full-featured interface for locating USGS water data sites.</li>
                <li>Allows easier viewing of sites for multiple states.</li>
                <li>Allows viewing of multiple site and data types at the same time.</li>
                <li>Adds spring sites.</li>
                <li>Improves searching by location, including by street address, zip code, or place name.</li>
              </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Links to the old interface will be automatically redirected, but if you have set a bookmark it would be best to change it to the new interface at <a href="https://maps.waterdata.usgs.gov/mapper/wateralert/">https://maps.waterdata.usgs.gov/mapper/wateralert/</a>.</li>
              </ul>
 
            <h2>March 19-20, 2013: WaterNow offline due to USGS EMail configuration changes.</h2>
           <ul>
             <li> <p><b>WaterNow</b> was unable to  receive  incoming messages after DNS Mail Exchanger (MX) records for <quot>usgs.gov</quot> were updated from Lotus to GMail.</p></li>
           </ul>

           <h2>January 7, 2013: WaterNow 1.0 Released</h2>
           <ul>
             <li> <p><b>WaterNow</b> is a new service that let's you query a USGS real-time gage at any time to quickly receive its latest observations.  Go to <a href="/waternow">WaterNow</a> to get started.</p></li>
           </ul>

           <h2>March 23, 2012: Temporary outage</h2>
           <ul>
             <li>Update: The GEOS-15 (GEOS WEST) satellite has been restored to service as of 11:09 am EDT. Data are again being transmitted.</li>
           </ul>

           <h2>March 22, 2012: Temporary outage</h2>
           <ul>
             <li><b>A satellite that relays current-conditions information is presently unavailable.</b> This mainly affects <b>western states</b> and there is no present time estimate on when the issue will be resolved. More information will be posted as it becomes available.</li>
           </ul>

            <h2>February 10, 2012: Temporary outage</h2>
            <ul>
              <li> <b>WaterAlert subscriptions will be unavailable</b>, starting today, Friday Feburary 10 from 3:00 PM ET until Sat Feburary 11 8:00 PM ET, due to routine system maintenance.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>April 19, 2011: Release of WaterAlert Version 1.2</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Updated Map Interface</b>
                <ul>
                  <li><b>Modified State and Data Type selection</b> - State or Territory and Data Type can now be selected in any order. Also, after initial selections have been made, an additional State can be added to the view, and the Data Type can be changed without having to reset the selections. Up to three States can be displayed at the same time.</li>
                  <li><b>Updated zoom controls</b> - New zoom controls to drag a zoom box (<img src="gmaps/icons/zoom-control-inactive.png" alt="zoom box"  height="12">) and to zoom back to the previous level (<img src="gmaps/icons/zoom-control-back.png" alt="zoom box" height="12">). The zoom controls obscure less of the map view than in the previous version.</li>
                  <li><b>Added overview map control</b> - Overview inset map in the lower-right corner.  This can be optionally hidden from the main map view.</li>
                  <li><b>New background map options</b> - Satellite map has been added as an option, and style of the menu has been modified to be consistent with related USGS mapping products.</li>
                </ul></li>
                <li><b>Simplified list of available parameters</b> - The general list of available parameters has been simplified to include only those that are available at most locations of a given Data Type. This is to reduce confusion where there are variations of a parameter, or where a parameter is only available at a few sites. In every case, a full list of parameters available for subscription is displayed when an individual site is selected.</li>
                <li><b>Peak chart</b> - As an aid for choosing an appropriate threshold value, a peak chart is now viewable on the Subscription Form for Gage Height (stage).</li>
                <li><b>Improved help</b> - Instructions, questions, and more detailed subscription-management help has been consolidated into one location (<a href="/wateralert/help/">https://water.usgs.gov/wateralert/help/</a>).</li>
            </ul>
