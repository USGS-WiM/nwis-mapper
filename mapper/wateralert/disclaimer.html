<h1>Disclaimer</h1>

This interface provides a map view of the locations of sites with USGS water data. ESRI maps are used to provide speed and versatility in a format that is familiar to many users. The interface can be used most efficiently by following a few basic rules:

<ol>
  <li>Center and zoom to area of interest.
  <li>Sites will not display until zoomed in to avoid clutter and 
      excessive drawing time.
  <li>Specific areas such as US states and territories can be selected
      using the drop-down list.
  <li>Named places can be selected using geographic searching.
</ol>

<p>

<h2>Background Views</h2>

Background maps and images, including any cartographic annotation, are furnished by organizations other than USGS and are subject to any limitations, disclaimers, or terms of use provided by them. The furnishing organization should be contacted for questions or to report errors regarding background maps and images. Views are created using prepared tiles that are matched to the scale being displayed, which provides very fast and nearly seamless zoom and pan, but also limits viewing to the tiles that are already available. In built-up areas in areas with large populations tiles are usually available for close-in zooming, but may not be available in some remote areas.

<p>
If background views are not available for close-in zooming in an area of interest, try using a different background. Generally, satellite views may provide the best available coverage in some remote areas.</p>

<p>
Following are sources and web links for background views used in this interface. The default background view is a Bing road map.
