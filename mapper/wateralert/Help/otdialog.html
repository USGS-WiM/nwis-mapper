		<h1>NWIS Site Types</h1>

		<p>
		There are 56 possible site types used in the NWIS data base, including 14 primary types and 42 secondary types. To simplify mapping of the site locations for most practical applications, the site types are displayed in 5 groups that include the following primary and secondary types. The full list of site types can be found <a href="Help/sitetype.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
</p>

		<p>
		The other group includes 6 primary and 28 secondary site types.</p>

		<p>
		Each site type is identified by a 2 to 7 character code. The first 2 characters identify the primary site type, and the remaining characters identify the secondary type. Most sites are one of the principal site types.<p>

<td>AG<BR></td>
<td>Aggregate groundwater use<BR></td>
<td>An Aggregate Groundwater Withdrawal/Return site represents an aggregate of specific sites whe groundwater is withdrawn or returned which is defined by a geographic area or some other common characteristic. An aggregate groundwatergroundwater site type is used when it is not possible or practical to describe the specific sites as springs or as any type of well including 'multiple wells', or when water-use information is only available for the aggregate. Aggregate sites that span multiple counties should be coded with 000 as the county code, or an aggregate site can be created for each county.<BR></td></tr>

<tr align="left">
<td>AS<BR></td>
<td>Aggregate surface-water-use<BR></td>
<td>An Aggregate Surface-Water Diversion/Return site represents an aggregate of specific sites where surface water is diverted or returned which is defined by a geographic area or some other common characteristic. An aggregate surface-water site type is used when it is not possible or practical to describe the specific sites as diversions, outfalls, or land application sites, or when water-use information is only available for the aggregate. Aggregate sites that span multiple counties should be coded with 000 as the county code, or an aggregate site can be created for each county.<BR></td></tr>

<tr align="left">
<td>AW<BR></td>
<td>Aggregate water-use establishment<BR></td>
<td>An Aggregate Water-Use Establishment represents an aggregate class of water-using establishments or individuals that are associated with a specific geographic location and water-use category, such as all the industrial users located within a county or all self-supplied domestic users in a county. The aggregate class of water-using establishments is identified using the national water-use category code and optionally classified using the Standard Industrial Classification System Code (SIC code) or North American Classification System Code (NAICS code). An aggregate water-use establishment site type is used when specific information needed to create sites for the individual facilities or users is not available or when it is not desirable to store the site-specific information in the database. Data entry rules that apply to water-use establishments also apply to aggregate water-use establishments. Aggregate sites that span multiple counties should be coded with 000 as the county code, or an aggregate site can be created for each county.<BR></td></tr>

<tr align="left">
<td>FA*<BR></td>

<tr align="left">
<td>FA-SEW<BR></td>
<td>Wastewater sewer<BR></td>
<td>An underground conduit created to convey liquid and semisolid domestic, commercial, or industrial waste into a treatment plant, stream, reservoir, or disposal site. If the sewer also conveys storm water, then the "combined sewer" secondary site type should be used.<BR></td></tr>

<td>A facility used to convey industrial waste, domestic sewage, brine, mine drainage, radioactive waste, or other fluid into an underground zone. An oil-test or deep-water well converted to waste disposal should be in this category. A well where fresh water is injected to artificially recharge thegroundwaterr supply or to pressurize an oil or gas production zone by injecting a fluid should be classified as a well (not an injection-well facility), with additional information recorded under Use of Site.<BR></td></tr>

<tr align="left">
<td>LA<BR></td>
<td>Land<BR></td>
<td>A location on the surface of the earth that is not normally saturated with water. Land sites are appropriate for sampling vegetation, overland flow of water, or measuring land-surface properties such as temperature.  (See also: Wetland).<BR></td></tr>

<tr align="left">
<td>LA-SNK<BR></td>
<td>Sinkhole<BR></td>
<td>A crater formed when the roof of a cavern collapses; usually found in limestone areas. Surface water and precipitation that enters a sinkhole usually evaporates or infiltrates into the ground, rather than draining into a stream.<BR></td></tr>
