		<h1>NWIS Site Types</h1>

		<p>
		There are 56 possible site types used in the NWIS data base, including 14 primary types and 42 secondary types. To simplify mapping of the site locations for most practical applications, the site types are displayed in 5 groups that include the following primary and secondary types. The full list of site types can be found <a href="Help/sitetype.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

		<p>
		The surface-water group includes 5 primary and 4 secondary site types.</p>

		<p>
		Each site type is identified by a 2 to 7 character code. The first 2 characters identify the primary site type, and the remaining characters identify the secondary type. Most sites are one of the principal site types.<p>

		<tr align="left">
		<td>ES<BR></td>
		<td>Estuary<BR></td>
		<td>A coastal inlet of the sea or ocean; esp. the mouth of a river, where tide water normally mixes with stream water (modified, Webster). Salinity in estuaries typically ranges from 1 to 25 Practical Salinity Units (psu), as compared oceanic values around 35-psu. See also: tidal stream and coastal.<BR></td></tr>

		<tr align="left">
		<td>LK<BR></td>
		<td>Lake, Reservoir, Impoundment<BR></td>
		<td>An inland body of standing fresh or saline water that is generally too deep to permit submerged aquatic vegetation to take root across the entire body (cf: wetland). This site type includes an expanded part of a river, a reservoir behind a dam, and a natural or excavated depression containing a water body without surface-water inlet and/or outlet.<BR></td></tr>

		<tr align="left">
		<td>OC<BR></td>
		<td>Ocean<BR></td>
		<td>Site in the open ocean, gulf, or sea. (See also: Coastal, Estuary, and Tidal stream).<BR></td></tr>

		<tr align="left">
		<td>OC-CO<BR></td>
		<td>Coastal<BR></td>
		<td>An oceanic site that is located off-shore beyond the tidal mixing zone (estuary) but close enough to the shore that the investigator considers the presence of the coast to be important. Coastal sites typically are within three nautical miles of the shore.<BR></td></tr>

		<tr align="left">
		<td>ST<BR></td>
		<td>Stream<BR></td>
		<td>A body of running water moving under gravity flow in a defined channel. The channel may be entirely natural, or altered by engineering practices through straightening, dredging, and (or) lining. An entirely artificial channel should be qualified with the "canal" or "ditch" secondary site type.<BR></td></tr>

		<tr align="left">
		<td>ST-CA<BR></td>
		<td>Canal<BR></td>
		<td>An artificial watercourse designed for navigation, drainage, or irrigation by connecting two or more bodies of water; it is larger than a ditch.<BR></td></tr>

		<tr align="left">
		<td>ST-DCH<BR></td>
		<td>Ditch<BR></td>
		<td>An excavation artificially dug in the ground, either lined or unlined, for conveying water for drainage or irrigation; it is smaller than a canal.<BR></td></tr>

		<tr align="left">
		<td>ST-TS<BR></td>
		<td>Tidal stream<BR></td>
		<td>A stream reach where the flow is influenced by the tide, but where the water chemistry is not normally influenced. A site where ocean water typically mixes with stream water should be coded as an estuary.<BR></td></tr>

		<tr align="left">
		<td>WE<BR></td>
		<td>Wetland<BR></td>
		<td>Land where saturation with water is the dominant factor determining the nature of soil development and the types of plant and animal communities living in the soil and on its surface (Cowardin, December 1979). Wetlands are found from the tundra to the tropics and on every continent except Antarctica. Wetlands are areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs and similar areas. Wetlands may be forested or unforested, and naturally or artificially created.<BR></td></tr>
