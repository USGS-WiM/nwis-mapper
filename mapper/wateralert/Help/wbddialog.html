		<h1>Watershed Boundary Dataset</h1>

		<p>The Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD) defines the areal extent of surface water drainage to a point, accounting for all land and surface areas. Watershed Boundaries are determined solely upon science-based hydrologic principles, not favoring any administrative boundaries or special projects, nor particular program or agency. The intent of defining Hydrologic Units (HU) for the Watershed Boundary Dataset is to establish a base-line drainage boundary framework, accounting for all land and surface areas. At a minimum, the WBD is being delineated and georeferenced to the USGS 1:24,000 scale topographic base map meeting National Map Accuracy Standards (NMAS).</p>

		<p>The WBD is being developed under the leadership of the <a href="https://acwi.gov/spatial/">Subcommittee on Spatial Water Data</a>, which is part of the <a href="https://acwi.gov/spatial/">Advisory Committee on Water Information</a> (ACWI) and the <a href="https://www.fgdc.gov/">Federal Geographic Data Committee</a> (FGDC). The USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), along with many other federal agencies and national associations, have representatives on the Subcommittee on Spatial Water Data.</p>

       <p>As watershed boundary geographic information systems (GIS) coverages are completed, statewide and national data layers will be made available via the <a href="https://datagateway.nrcs.usda.gov/">Geospatial Data Gateway</a> to everyone, including federal, state, local government agencies, researchers, private companies, utilities, environmental groups, and concerned citizens. The database will assist in planning and describing water use and related land use activities.</p>
       
       <p>The WBD is a specific application of the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD), which is a digital vector dataset used by Geographic Information Systems (GIS). The NHD contains features such as lakes, ponds, streams, rivers, canals, dams and stream gages. These data are designed to be used in general mapping and in the analysis of surface water systems. NHD Flowlines are important features in the NHD because they contain flow direction and form a network. In mapping, the NHD is used with other data themes such as elevation, boundaries, and transportation to produce general reference maps. The NHD is often used by scientists using GIS technology. GIS takes advantage of a rich set of attributes that can be processed to generate specialized information. These analyses are possible because the NHD contains a flow direction network that traces the water downstream or upstream. The NHD also uses an addressing system to link specific information about the water such as discharge rates, water quality, and fish population. Using the basic NHD attributes, flow network, linked information, and other characteristics, it is possible to study cause and affect relationships such as how a source of poor water quality upstream might affect a fish population downstream. The features in the NHD are organized into polygons, lines and points. The polygons most commonly portray waterbodies such as lakes while lines commonly portray streams. The stream lines are broken into shorter segments stretching from confluence-to-confluence. The segments are then linked together to trace the flow of water across the landscape. Flowlines attributed as artificial paths are added inside water bodies to maintain the flow network. </p>
