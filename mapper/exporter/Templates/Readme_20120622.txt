File: Readme.txt

Summary:

	The NWIS Mapper provides the ability to export NWIS Site information
	for sites displayed on the Mapper. Exporting data requires not the
	data itself, but metadata (data about data) and other ancillary
	information. Because a variable number of files are required for
	the different export formats, NWIS Mapper Export data are distributed
	in a .zip archive. The archive provides a container for all the
	files required during the export process. In general, there are three
	types of files in the .zip archive:

				1) General Information - found in this Readme.txt file
				2) Metadata - found in the Metadata.txt file
				3) Site Data - the actual data itself, found in one or more
						files named NWISMapperExport.xxx.


Details:

General Information:
	The first file, Readme.txt, describes the other two files and their formats.

Metadata:
	The third file, called Metadata.txt, provides information
about the export process and data file. It includes information about the date
and time the data export was requested, what kind of sites were exported, what
kind of data are associated with the exported sites, how many NWIS Sites were
included in the export file, and the longitude and latitude extents that contain
the requested data.

Site Data:
	The second file is named NWISMapperExport.xxx and contains the actual
NWIS Mapper export data. The file extension for NWISMapperExport depends on the
requested export format. There are 7 export formats with 7 corresponding file
extensions, each summarized in the following descriptions. In general, site
data exported from the NWIS Mapper provide the following data fields from
the NWIS Site information database:

		Site Number - a unique ID number in the NWIS database for the site.
			Example: 14335072

		Site Name - a textual description of the site.
			Example: UPPER KLAMATH LAKE AT ROCKY POINT, OR

		Site Category - an NWIS code that describes the type of site. For
			Example: LK (surface-water site at a lake)

		Site Agency - the agency responsible for the site.
			Example: USGS

		Site Longitude - the longitude of the site. Units are decimal degrees,
			horizontal datum is North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83). Positive
			values represent locations in the Eastern Hemisphere, while negative
			values represent locations in the Western Hemisphere.
			Example: -90.075 (a line of longitude that runs approximately through
			New Orleans, LA, USA).

		Site Latitude  - the latitude of the site. Units are decimal degrees,
			horizontal datum is North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83). Positive
			values represent locations in the Northern Hemisphere, while negative
			values represent locations in the Southern Hemisphere.
			Example: 41.0604 (a line of latitude that runs approximately through
			Fort Wayne, IN, USA).
			
		Site NWIS URL - the web link to the NWIS database for the site.
			Example: https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/inventory?agency_code=USGS&site_no=11502500

Description of Export Formats
	============================================================================
	Table of Sites
	============================================================================
	Export Format Name:		Table of Sites
	File Format: 					Hypertext Markup Language
	Filename extension:		.html
	Explanation: 					Exported data formatted for display in a web browser

	============================================================================
	List of Site Numbers
	============================================================================
	Export Format Name:		List of Site Numbers
	File Format:					ASCII text
	Filename extension:		.txt
	Explanation: 					A simple list of NWIS Site Numbers separated by commas.
	The Site Numbers can be pasted into NWIS query forms to facilitate data
	retrieval for known sites.

	============================================================================
	Microsoft Excel
	============================================================================
	Export Format Name:		Microsoft Excel
	File Format:					Binary
	Filename extension:		.xls
	Explanation: 					A binary tabular format used natively by Microsoft's
	Excel spreadsheet software, and capable of being imported by numerous other
	software applications. The first row in the spreadsheet includes the
	following column headers representing the NWIS Sites field information:
		SiteNumber
		SiteName
		SiteCategory
		SiteAgency
		SiteLongitude
		SiteLatitude
		SiteNWISURL

	============================================================================
	Comma Separated
	============================================================================
	Export Format Name:		Comma Separated
	File Format:					ASCII text
	Filename extension:		.csv
	Explanation: 					A textual tabular format compatible with many software
	applications. Each line or row in the file represents an NWIS site and
	associated information. Data values are separated by commas. In addition,
	text values are delimited by double quotes. The first row of the file
	contains the column names or names of the data fields:
		SiteNumber
		SiteName
		SiteCategory
		SiteAgency
		SiteLongitude,
		SiteLatitude
		SiteNWISURL

	============================================================================
	Tab Separated
	============================================================================
	Export Format Name:		Tab Separated
	File Format:					ASCII text
	Filename extension:		.rdb
	Explanation: 					A textual tabular format compatible with many software
	applications. Each line or row in the file represents an NWIS site and
	associated information. All data values are separated by TAB characters.
	The first row	of the file contains the column names or names of the data
	fields. The second row of the file contains information that describes
	each data field in terms of length and type. The length of the field is
	the maximum number of characters used to store the data values. A data
	field can be one of three types: String, Date, or Number, designated
	respectively by S, D, or N. For example, the value for an NWIS Station
	Name is "50S",meaning a string of up to 50 characters. The field
	information in the file is:

	SiteNumber SiteName SiteCategory SiteAgency SiteLongitude SiteLatitude SiteNWISURL
	25S 50S 2S 10S 15N 15N 50S

	============================================================================
	Keyhole Markup Language
	============================================================================
	Export Format Name:		Keyhole Markup Language
	File Format:					ASCII text
	Filename extension:		.kml
	Explanation:					Keyhole Markup Language is an XML based markup
	language used by geographic applications such as Google Maps and
	Google Earth. KML describes the location of	geographic features and
	their attributes and allows software to place those features on
	maps.

	============================================================================
	ESRI ShapeFile
	============================================================================
	Export Format Name:		ESRI ShapeFile
	File Format:					binary
	Filename extension:		.shp, .dbf, .shx
	Explanation:					A data format for storing, managing, and displaying
	geographic data and associated tabular information. ShapeFiles were
	developed by Environmental Systems Research Institute, developers of
	Geographic Information Systems (GIS) software and related products and
	technologies. Many geographic software applications are capable of
	importing ESRI ShapeFiles. Conceptually, an ESRI ShapeFile is a container
	for storing geographic data and the physical implementation of that
	container requires a minimum of three physical disk files. The geometry
	of the geographic features is stored in a file with the extension .shp,
	the tabular attributes associated the geographic features are stored
	in a file with a .dbf extension, and the index between the geometry
	and attributes is stored in a file with the extension .shx. The field
	information for Shapefiles is dependent on the dBase format:

		SITENO		Data Type: Character,	Width:	25
		SITENAME	Data Type: Character,	Width:	50
		CATEGORY	Data Type: Character,	Width:	2
		AGENCY		Data Type: Character,	Width:	10
		LONGDD		Data Type: Character,	Width:	15
		LATDD			Data Type: Character,	Width:	15
		SITEURL		Data Type: Character,	Width:	50
